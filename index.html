        <h2>Dana Archer</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Dana! I'm currently studying Computer Science. Some little facts about me: I love cats!, I was homeschooled up to university level, and I love to draw :).</p>
        <p> As somewhat of an amateur artist, the idea of being able to design websites was very appealing to me. Web development feels like the middle ground between my artistic aspirations and my coding background. I am very much looking forward to building larger websites one day.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of my art!</p>
